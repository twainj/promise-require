# promise-require
A Promise-based dependency management library for JavaScript.

Defines require() function that operates similar to other dependency management systems (a la RequireJS). Compatibility with those systems is currently undefined. 

It is hoped that by basing the asynchronous loading of scripts on Promises, we can eliminate the amount of code necessary for dependency management.

# Work in progress.
This is a placeholder for anticipated work. There may be work done (code and design) not reflected in this repository. If you are interested in this project, comments/questions/discussion welcome! Also, this is largely a learning project, and TikiTDO/ultralight_amd, at first glance, may be an implementation already existing with the same motivation.
